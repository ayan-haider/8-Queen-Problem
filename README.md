# 8-Queen-Problem
Solved the 8-Queen problem using a genetic algorithm written in Elixir.

The algorithm focuses more on mutating the chromosome rather than creating new children or having a huge initial population.

Run the `run.exs` file inside the `scripts` directory using the `mix run scripts/run.exs` command.
